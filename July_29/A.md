The Fool is numbered 0 – the number of unlimited potential –and therefore does not have a specific place in the sequence of the Tarot cards. The Fool can be placed either at the beginning of the Major Arcana or at the end. The Major Arcana is often considered as the Fool’s journey through life and as such, he is
ever present and therefore needs no number.
